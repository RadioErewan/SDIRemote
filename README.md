The SDI Remote for Black Magic is the missing control panel for your camera. With the SDI Remote you can control up to 40 different camera settings, including zoom, focus, aperture, and 24 color correction settings, such as color lift, gamma, gain, offset (in all four channels), as well as contrast (pivot and adjustment), color hue and saturation. With the SDI Remote your camera becomes the most versatile tool on the market. Today the remote works as follow focus, follow aperture, and follow zoom (this feature requires power-zoom lenses). The SDI Remote also includes time lapse functionality (changing parameters in preprogrammed time period).
